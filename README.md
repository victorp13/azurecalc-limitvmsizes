## Limit VM sizes in Azure Calculator

### An Edge Extension (yet unpublished)

This extension allows filtering of the VM dropdown based on number of Cores and Memory. It applies this filter to all VM dropdowns on the page, so handle with care!

To install, enable "Developer Mode" on the Edge Chromium Extensions page and "Load unpacked" this root folder. I am working on publishing this as a package to the official Edge extensions store.
